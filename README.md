# FHIR Application Console App

In this project I am connecting to a [FHIR Public test server](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Public+Test+Servers) using C# and FHIR .NET libraries in order to retrieve and display its data to the user.

I've begun this project independently to study how the [FHIR standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/modules.html) works and how to interact with database systems utilizing it.

This is in-progress as of Spring 2025 and I expect to expand its functionality soon.
